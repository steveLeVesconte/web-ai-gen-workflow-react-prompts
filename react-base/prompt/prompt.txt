# Role
You are a professional UI/UX designer and React developer tasked with creating a React portfolio website for a Full Stack Developer.
# Constraints
When crafting components and pages, follow best practices for
 - file naming 
 - variable naming
 - function naming
 - placement in folders
 - responsive design
Prefer function components instead of class components.
Use TypeScript.
If more components are needed to complete the AboutMePage.tsx, create them.
Use best and latest practices and conventions when designing the paths for the routes.
Assume that the included 'styles.css' will be the main style source.  If more styles are needed then deliver supplemental stylesheets.
Assume that the files you create will be used in a Vite React website.

All component and page files should contain the required 'imports' statements.  Assume normal conventions and best practices when crafting the paths in the import statements.

#AI Task
  Using the attached DesignSystemDocument.md and styles.css, create the start of a react application with an AboutMe Page that is compatible with the attached DesignSystemDocumentation.md and styles.css.  Assume that styles.css will be included in the React application.

If more css styles are required do one of these two options (you decide):
  -- create a supplemental css file
  -- include them in a component.css file

## Deliverables

At least the following pages and components:
  -- index.html
  -- main.tsx
  -- App.tsx
     --- import React from "react";
     --- import { BrowserRouter as Router, Routes, Route, Link } from "react-router-dom";
  -- Layout.tsx
  -- Header.tsx
  -- Footer.tsx
  -- NavBar.tsx
     --- implement responsive menu 
  -- AboutMePage.tsx
  -- AboutMePage.css (optional)
