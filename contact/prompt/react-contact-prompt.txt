# Attached Context Files:
- DesignSystemDocument.md
- styles.css
- contact.css
- App.tsx

# Constraints:
- Reuse existing CSS and JavaScript whenever possible from these files:
  -- styles.css
  -- contact.css
- Employ CSS best practices to create, name and reuse CSS variables.
- Employ best practices to support responsive design.
- Organize and comment the CSS file to allow you (the AI) and developers to easily apply the styles and CSS variables.

- When crafting components and pages, follow best practices for:
  -- file naming 
  -- variable naming
  -- function naming
  -- placement in folders

- Prefer function components instead of class components.
- Use TypeScript.
- If more components are needed to complete the ContactPage.tsx, create them.
- Use best and latest practices and conventions when designing the paths for the routes.
- Assume that the included 'styles.css' and 'contact.css' will be the main style source.  If more styles are needed then deliver supplemental stylesheets or a component.css file.
- Assume that the files you create will be used in an existing Vite React website.
- Create an aspect-ratio-box for each image to hold space while the image loads.
  -- aspect-ratio: 9/16

# Contact Page Layout:
- Main Content Aria Contains:
  -- Make up Sample content - consider including any or all of the following elements and more if needed:
    --- Sample Title
    --- Sample Subtitle
    --- Sample paragraphs
        ---- Sample Article Images 
             ----- Placeholder: src="https://picsum.photos/1200/600" 
    --- Sample Contact Form

#AI Task:
-  Using the attached context files, create new components for an existing react application for a Contact Page that is compatible with the attached DesignSystemDocument.md and styles.css.  
-  Assume that styles.css and contact.css will be included in the React application.

## Deliverables
At least the following pages and components:
  -- ContactPage.tsx
