# Constraints:
- Reuse existing CSS and JavaScript whenever possible from styles.css
- Employ CSS best practices to create, name and reuse CSS variables.
- Employ best practices to support responsive design.
- Organize and comment the CSS file to allow you (the AI) and developers to easily apply the styles and CSS variables.

- When crafting components and pages, follow best practices for:
  -- file naming 
  -- variable naming
  -- function naming
  -- placement in folders

- Prefer function components instead of class components.
- Use TypeScript.
- Use best and latest practices and conventions when designing the paths for the routes.
- Assume that the included 'styles.css' will be the main style source.  If more styles are needed then deliver supplemental stylesheets or a project.css file.
- Assume that the files you create will be used in an existing Vite React website.
- Create an aspect-ratio-box for each image to hold space while the image loads.
  -- aspect-ratio: 9/16

# ProjectPage002 Layout:
- Main Content Aria Contains:
  -- Make up Sample content about "React Go Game for Two Players":


# AI Task:
-  Using the attached context files, create new components for an existing react application for a ProjectPage0002 page that is compatible with the attached DesignSystemDocument.md and styles.css.  
-  Using the Article Outline, and the attached ArticleContent.txt, generate the article contents.
-  Suggest images to include in the Article Images to include at various points in the text.  Use a placeholder: src="https://picsum.photos/1200/600" 
-  Assume that styles.css will be included in the React application.

## Deliverables
- ProjectPage0002.tsx
